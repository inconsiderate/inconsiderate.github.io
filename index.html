        <p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ey, nice to meet you. I'm Mike. I'm a Web Developer based in Vancouver, BC. This is my slice of the internet.</p>
        <p>I like to talk about a lot of stuff. Mostly developement stuff that I've learned about and felt like sharing, but also some stuff about board games and other interests.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in me for a project I have a wide array of skills. Backend and DB design, devops and cloud deployments, SPAs and front-end minimalism. I do most of my coding in PHP, JavaScript, and Node, and my cloud expertise is in AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean, and that sort of stuff. I've also done a bit of WordPress and Jekyll work, if you're into that. ;)</p>
        <p>Check out my Blog and personal Projects, dive into my semi-not-regularly updated Thoughts, or hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelkant">Twitter</a>. Whether you're interested in me for a project or just want to chat, I'm always happy to talk.</p>
