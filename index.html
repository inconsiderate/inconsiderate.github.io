        <p>Some people use the phrase "full stack engineer." I prefer "developer."</p>
        <p>I have a broad focus in web development. Server-side design, devops and cloud deployments, SPAs and front-end minimalism. I do most of my coding in PHP, JavaScript, and Node, and my cloud expertise is in AWS, Heroku, Digital Ocean, and the like.</p>
        <p>Check out my Blog and personal Projects, dive into my semi-regularly updated Thoughts, or hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelkant">Twitter</a>. Whether you're interested in me for a project or just want to chat, I'm always happy to talk.</p>
