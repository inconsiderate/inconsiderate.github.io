#### The holiday season is (pretty much) here!
My local ~~Chapters~~ Indigo has Santa hats and lights up in all the windows, and my tongue is already numb from the Starbucks sugar-bomb known as the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha. Mmmm... mocha. New favourite holiday drink? Yes. When the red cups come out, we all know what that means. All sorts of wintery activities are just around the corner! Here's some of my favorite things to do around this time of year.

#### [Board Game Geek Secret Santa](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1868050/24-hours-go-register-bgg-secret-santa-deadline-joi)

Each year since 2005 (wow, this has been going on for a long time) [BGG](http://boardgamegeek.com) does a fantastic Secret Santa for board games across the site (and world). This year I've put my name in the hat and I'll be joining in with the buying fun. Hopefully my target won't be too difficult to buy for!

#### [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
Who doesn't love advent calendars? And programming?! Advent of Code combines these two things into something practical, fun, and at times quite challenging. There have been some pretty good exercises here in past years, and I'm hoping to do this with my office again this year. Competition really brings out the best in people. ;)

Don't forget to do part two each day for the bonus points!

#### [Vancouver Hot Chocolate Festival](http://hotchocolatefest.com/)
I guess it's a little early to get excited (too bad, I'm salivating just from thinking about it), and they haven't updated the site yet, but every year in Vancouver there's a Hot Chocolate Festival with different concoctions at fine coffee shops (and chocolate shops - I'm looking at you, Mink) around the city.
